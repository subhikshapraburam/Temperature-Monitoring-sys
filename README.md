The circuit for temperature monitoring system consist of an arduino  , bread board , a temperature sensor and for the output I have used an RGB LED.
The LED will turn Blue when the temperature of a patient is normal, when the temperature is below 36째C.
The LED will turn green when the temperature of a patient is increasing , when the temperature is between 36째C to 40째C.This is the alert range 
The LED will turn red when the temperature of a patient is high , when the temperature is greater than  40째C.
